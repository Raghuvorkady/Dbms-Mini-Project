# Library Management System (with Voice based search)


### Steps to push:

1. Open the command prompt and change the directory (choose a folder to maintain the local repos ex. dbms project)

2. Run the command
	
	> Type: **git clone https://github.com/Raghuvorkady/Dbms-Mini-Project.git**

3. Next it will prompt you to enter your GitHub username/email and password

4. Now after successfull clone(download), create a new django project inside the folder "djangoProject"

For the above step again open the command prompt and change the directory to the folder "djangoProject"
	
	> Type: **django-admin startproject speechTest**
	
	> Type: **python manage.py startapp srt**

And now it's time for some django work, designing a simple ui to input a speech and extract the output

5. Open the cmd, change the dir to **Dbms-Mini-Project** (the cloned repo)
	
	> Type: **git status**
	
	> Type: **git add ***
	
	> Type: **git commit -m "YOURNAME speech commit"**
	
	> Type: **git push**
	
	> Type: **git status** (Ouput should be: nothing to commit, working tree clean)

6. If successfully pushed, all will receive a mail.

7. For updating your local repo, whenever someone pushes to the remote repo
	> Type: **git pull**

Note: push request will not work, if your local repo is not updated with the remote repo.

So if you face any rejected message whenever you push, follow Step 7.
